# Pop Youtube

Basic useful feature list:

 * Show the 10 most popular youtube videos in the world
 * You can save the video to watch later
 * The APP uses the YouTube API to run the video directly
 * Performs requests on secondary threads

## Brief 
The application was created during the programming class on mobile devices at Mackenzie Presbyterian University in the second half of 2016.    
We do not have a possible date for in-store publishing, feel free to look and modify code, only changing the key to access the Youtube API.
